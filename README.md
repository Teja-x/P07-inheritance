# P07 â€“ Inheritance (Bank Account System)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates **inheritance in Java** using a real-world banking example.  
The base class `BankAccount` defines common properties and methods (account number, balance, deposit, withdraw).  
Two subclasses extend it with specialized behavior:

- **SavingsAccount** â†’ supports applying interest to the balance  
- **CurrentAccount** â†’ supports overdraft facility (allows withdrawing more than balance up to a limit)

This project is about OOP fundamentals.

## ðŸ›  Concepts Covered
- **Inheritance** â€“ `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount` extend `BankAccount`  
- **Constructor Chaining** â€“ passing values from child classes to parent class constructor  
- **Method Overriding** â€“ redefining `withdraw()` logic in `CurrentAccount`  
- **Encapsulation** â€“ keeping balance/account details private, modifying through methods
